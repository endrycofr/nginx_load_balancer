# Nginx Load Balancer with Round Robin

This project demonstrates the setup of an Nginx load balancer using the round-robin algorithm to distribute traffic across multiple backend servers.

## Overview

In this setup, Nginx serves as the load balancer, and it evenly distributes incoming client requests among three backend applications (`App 1`, `App 2`, and `App 3`) using the round-robin strategy. This approach ensures that each application receives requests in a cyclical manner, balancing the load across all available servers.

## Architecture

![Load Balancer Architecture](path_to_diagram.png)

The diagram above illustrates the architecture:

1. **Client**: Sends requests to the Nginx load balancer.
2. **Nginx Load Balancer**: Receives the requests and distributes them to the backend servers using round-robin.
3. **App 1, App 2, App 3**: Backend servers that process client requests.
